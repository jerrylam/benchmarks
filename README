 This is a script to automate benchmarking of various IO performance tests.
 (bonnie++, iozone, and sysbench)
 It formats your device ext3, ext4, and xfs, so you can compare the benchmarks.

 It can be used with various protocols like IPoIB, SDP, SSOCKS, and IPv4.
 Run this script for each protocol you want to test, once the environment is set up.
 You can also swap out different disks to see how they perform.
 Use with 'tee' to save results.

 *** WARNING: ALL DATA WILL BE DESTROYED on the device you choose. *** 
     These benchmarks reformat and overwrite the given device during testing.
     Usually this is a good thing, testing out a new device configuration, 
     just don't choose the wrong device.
